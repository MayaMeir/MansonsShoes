                I started this site with people like me in mind - those who arent afraid to speak their mind and show their passion for arts through shoes.
                There isnt a single item in the store that I wouldnâ€™t buy myself - and that's my goal - to create something that I truly believe in, and that I would enjoy as a customer.
                I hope you will have a great time scrolling around and finding the right pair for you.
                enjoy, Maya</p></Col>
